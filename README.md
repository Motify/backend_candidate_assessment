# Motify backend developer evaluation

The motivation for creating this repository came from this blog post: [The One Method Iâ€™ve Used to Eliminate Bad Tech Hires](https://mattermark.com/the-one-method-ive-used-to-eliminate-bad-tech-hires/).

It doesn't eliminate the need of an interview, but helps to better assess the candidate skills and verify if he fits in our needs.

Further explanations will be given to each candidate individually.


# Support
